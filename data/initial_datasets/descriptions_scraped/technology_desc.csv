As teaching assistants in the Department of Political Science, they spent a lot of time teaching UCLA undergraduates. After a while they noticed a pattern: their students were all smart and hard working, but the very best of the best -- the ones who really stood out from the crowd -- were often from less affluent backgrounds.These students had the academic talent and drive to get into a great school like UCLA, but they were also lucky, because college admissions isnâ€™t a level playing field. The competition is fierce, and naturally, applicants use every tool at their disposal to succeed. For every one of the lucky ones who made it into a school like UCLA, how many other great students had missed out on getting into the best possible school for them, simply because they couldnâ€™t afford to hire expert help to guide them through the process?We built ApplyMap to answer this question. We want to fill the growing need for high quality college advice in an intelligent, intuitive and affordable way. Our job is to help as many students as we can understand the possibilities and risks when applying to college. The more you know before you apply, the better off youâ€™ll be when the fat envelopes start to arriveâ€¦ and we want to celebrate with you when they do!

158|Benson Hill Biosystems|Boosting crop yields on existing acreage and with limited inputs is the foremost challenge in sustainable production agriculture.With the global population projected to reach nine billion by 2050, agricultural output must increase by 70% in this timeframe. As nations such as the United States pursue agriculture-intensive energy policies, demand and price volatility for agriculture commodities will continue to intensify. Diminishing agricultural resources such as arable land and fresh water will further compound this challenge.In the last twenty years, crop yields have improved from intensive breeding programs, increased planting densities, and biotech traits such as insect resistance and herbicide tolerance. However, blockbuster trait releases in recent years are only having single digit percentage impacts on yield. At a time when step changes are needed in crop productivity, yields are plateauing.One contributing factor to the decline in crop development is that nearly all commercial biotech traits are single-gene approaches to protecting yield. But to realize step changes and avoid a yield plateau, we must innovate beyond single-gene approaches to protecting yield, and realize step wise gains by increasing intrinsic yield.Benson Hill is dedicated to delivering substantial production gains to the agriculture sector by advancing biotech-based traits to increase intrinsic yield.

209|Briefcase|"""More than 40 percent of recent U.S. college graduates are underemployed...""  ""Fewer than half of college graduates from (2009 on) found their first job within 12 months of graduating..."". The kind of data they need is longitudinal dataâ€¦what they need is better outcomes data from higher education institutions so that they know over time what models are the most successful for people, so parents and students can make a determination about what works well for them.The major challenges facing most university and college placement offices is assuring their students the broadest possible exposure to employment opportunities, followed closely by analysis of prior student employment outcomes, by major, location or other cohort factors. Briefcase solves both issues, beginning with optimizing employment exposure. Several major universities, representing over 189k students are already committed to the use of The Briefcase Platform to offset this issue and to bring transparency to their ecosystem.The present problem may be broken into two large categories; first: assisting current graduates in finding the best full-time employment opportunities given their own and related circumstances, and two: tracking, analyzing and reporting to aspirant graduates, their advisors and supporters as to the current and projected opportunities and outcomes associated with various areas (majors) of studies, eventually growing to include comparison between majors based on institution."

Similarly, our aim is not to throw 1000 search results for a query, but to limit it to a relevant yet manageable set. Our searchbox is designed to accept the most generic search term like ""brown handbags"" or ""green jeans for girls"", and results can be further narrowed down using category, brand and price filters."

295|CodeGuard|"CodeGuard provides website backup, monitoring, and malware remediation services to small and medium businesses.  As anyone who has ever tried to recover a crashed or hacked website can attest, the ""back-up"" systems of many web hosting providers leave a lot to be desired. The back-ups sound reassuring in theory--you are assured that your data is always ""backed-up"" on a system that is completely separate from the main one and that you'll be able to access it whenever you need it.  When disaster strikes, your site has been hacked or your developer make a simple mistake, you often discover that your backup is hard to access, out-of-date or has been affected by the same event.CodeGuard is unlike ISP-based-backups. Instead of a static snapshot of your site kept by your ISP (hopefully), we use a File Integrity Monitoring system built on a version control system and store site data in the cloud.  CodeGuard backups are stored as the differential between each daily scan of the site; allowing users visibility into what has changed along with the ability to undoÂ changes on their site and restore to a past version in real time, much like Time Machine for Apple OS does for your laptop.  If the current backup solutions for webmasters are lackluster, then the systems that alert webmasters if their site has been hacked are absolutely appalling. Webmasters discover they have been hacked because traffic suddenly disappears, they see a warning message on Google when searching for themselves, or they get an email from a customer complaining about strange behavior.  CodeGuard's differential backup approach revolutionizes hacking detection and remediation. Rather than relying solely upon site scans and comparisons with known threats, we scan files that have been modified since our last backup  This allows us to identify hacking and alert the site owner before they can spread malware, have their links pirated or act as a parasitic host for spammers--and before safe browsing alerts quarantines the site and kills all of the traffic.  In the event a hack or an unauthorized change is detected, webmasters can quickly revert to the last known goodÂ version and have their site working in minutes without engaging a developer to remediate the issue."
